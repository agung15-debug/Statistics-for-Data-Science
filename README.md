## Inferential Statistics ##
Inferential statistics help you come to conclusions and make predictions based on your data.

When you have collected data from a sample, you can use inferential statistics to understand the larger population from which the sample is taken.

Inferential statistics have two main uses:
* making estimates about populations (for example, the mean SAT score of all 11th graders in the US).
* testing hypotheses to draw conclusions about populations (for example, the relationship between SAT scores and family income).


### Confidence Interval ###
In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates for an unknown parameter. A confidence interval is computed at a designated confidence level; the 95% confidence level is most common, but other levels, such as 90% or 99%, are sometimes used

### Hypothesis Testing ###
Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.

Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process. The word "population" will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions.
